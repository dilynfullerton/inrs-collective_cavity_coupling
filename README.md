# inrs-collective_cavity_coupling

This code is meant to implement the results of the paper
[_Quantum theory of collective strong coupling of molecular 
vibrations with a microcavity mode_][paper]
by J. del Pino, J. Feist, and F. J. Garcia-Vidal.


_**WARNING**_: I have not properly cleaned up and finalized this code yet.
